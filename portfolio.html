					<h4>U.S. Department of Defense</h4>

					<img />

					<h5>The Problem</h5>

					<p>The American Forces Travel (AFT) website required military members to verify their status with the U.S. Department of Defense before they were able to view exclusive travel discounts. A large percentage of eligible users visiting the site were not doing this so they were never seeing the travel deals available to them.</p>

						<li>Analytics</li>
						<li>User research</li>
						<li>Prototyping</li>
						<li>UI design</li>

					<h4>Priceline Phone Agent Platform</h4>

					<img />

					<h5>The Problem</h5>

					<p>The Priceline phone agents who book travel for customers over the phone were using the same ecommerce platform that the general public was using to search and book travel. This platform was never designed for the needs of a phone agent. We didn't know how they were using the platform or why customers were choosing to book travel over the phone.</p>

					<h5>My Role</h5>

						<li>User research</li>
						<li>UI design</li>

			<h3>Other Work Examples</h3>

			<div class="portfolio">

				<h4>Redhead Equipment</h4>

				<p>Redhead Equipment didn't know if they should spend the time and money to invest in building a new corporate website. They didn't know how their staff and customers felt about the current web experience or how they performed compared to their competitors.</p>

				<p>My role was to design and execute a user research project that including interviewing customers and staff to learn about how they felt about the Redhead Equipment brand and their experiences using the website. This project included competitor analysis, SEO reviews and recommend UI design changes to better align with customer needs.</p>

				<h4>Meet My Blank</h4>

				<p>A client had an idea for a new social media site. He had defined the problem the site was intended to solve and had created user personas but could not visualize how the site would work. We were hired to design and develop the new platform.</p>

				<p>My role was to collaborate with the lead designer on the project to create user journey maps for each of the user types and create an initial sitemap. This included mapping out each user touchpoint during the onboarding flow and for each of the top tasks. These documents were critical in aligning the entire team’s understanding of the project.</p>

				<h4>Chinook Lumber</h4>

				<p>Chinook Lumber was looking to completely redesign their corporate website. As the Interactive Director, my role included working with the client to learn about their needs and the needs of their customers. I also was responsible for auditing all of their existing content and assets and leading the design of the new website. I created the documents below as part of this project.</p>

				<h4>Mayberry Fine Arts</h4>

				<p>Mayberry Fine Arts needed a new website that allow them to more easily update their inventory of art available, and also allowed them to target more organic search engine traffic. They wanted to be a leader in the sale of artwork by Canadian artists and needed to have their site better optmized for search engines to accomplish this. They also wanted to utilize their new artwork API to power the site.</p>

				<p>My role was to meet with the different departments within the company to learn about how they used their existing site and what frustrations they had. We also collaborated on the type of content and online tools that their target audience would value. My role was to design and build this new website which utilized ArtMoi's existing art inventory API.</p>

					<li>User research</li>
					<li><a href="">Website design</a></li>
					<li>API integration</li>
					<li>React development</li>
					<li>SEO</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>ArtMoi</h4>

				<p>I was helping ArtMoi define what type of KPIs they should be focusing on to help guide their design and development. I decided to review the experience new members were having when they first signed up. I found that most people were signing up for the free service and then leaving the site without trying to use the software. I found that ArtMoi was forcing first time users to walk through a guide that outlined how to use the software. I thought this might be causing users to abandon the site.</p>

				<p>I had a new solution in mind but I wanted to user test it first. We set it up so that 50% of the new users would continue getting the existing experience and the other half would get a new experience. For these users I disabled the forced walkthrough and designed a new landing page that provided quick links to key tasks but did not block them from exploring the site how they wanted. This new method was a success and we quickly rolled it out to all new users.</p>

				<h4>Cabela's Canada</h4>

				<p>Cabela's customers found that shopping for firearm ammunition was very overwhelming, especially for customers who were new to firearm ownership. Cabela's asked us to design a tool that would make choosing easier. I produced the following wireframe for a multi step questionnaire that would help their customers easily narrow down their choices.</p>
