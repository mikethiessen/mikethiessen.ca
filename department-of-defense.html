			<h1>U.S. Department of Defense</h1>

			<h2>The American Forces Travel (AFT) website required military members to verify their status with the U.S. Department of Defense before they were able to view exclusive travel discounts. I implemented user flow tracking through Google Analytics. I was reviewing the data and found that a large percentage of eligible users visiting the site were not going through the authorization process so they were never seeing the travel deals available to them.</h2>

			<h3>1. Empathize</h3>

			<div class="portfolio">

				<h4>User Research</h4>

				<p>We could not speak directly to any of the military members so instead I used usertesting.com to speak to them. I created a user test targeting members of the military and had them visit the site.</p>

				<p>Usertesting.com allows us to create a 5-second test which allowed me to show the home page to a user for 5 seconds to see what immediately stood out to them.</p>

				<h5>Some of the things we were trying to learn:</h5>

				<ul>
					<li>When landing on the home page, do users quickly understand the value the website offers?</li>
					<li>What do the users expect to see when they click the 'Get Started' button?</li>
					<li>Do they understand what the site's relationship is with the Department of Defense?</li>
					<li>When landing on the authorization page, is it clear to them why they need to go through this process?</li>
					<li>Do they feel comfortable entering their personal information to gain access to the website's travel discounts?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<h3>2. Define</h3>

			<div class="portfolio">

				<h4>User Research</h4>

				<p>After reviewing the results of the user tests it was clear there were 2 important issues I needed to focus on for our design updates.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Users did not understand that the website was a product of the U.S. Department of Defense.</li>
					<li>Users were not comfortable entering their SIN number to access the website.
				</ol>
			</div>

			<h3>3. Ideate</h3>

			<div class="portfolio">

				<p>I met with our client and the members of our account team to discuss some possible solutions. What made changing the site more difficult was that there were very strict legal guidelines from the Department of Defense for what type of imagery we could use and what the content needed to me. We came up with a list of changes that would likely get approval.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>4. Prototype</h3>

			<div class="portfolio">

				<h4>UI Design</h4>

				<p>I then created a new design for a phone agent version of our ecommerce platform which included the ideas from our design studio. I also needed to work within the Pricelinen design system using existing components when necessary.</p>

				<h5>The design below included a lot of the ideas generated from our design studio. Some of these incuded:</h5>

				<ol>
					<li>Implementing a "scratchpad" at the top of the screen where the agent could add personal information the caller had given them that would then populate the checkout form later in the process.</li>
					<li>A map tool that would allow the agent add a map pin for a point of interest making it easier to find hotels near that location.</li>
					<li>An inline tab system within the search results which would allow agents to quickly compare important information between hotel options.</li>
					<li>A hotel score for both cleanliness and location which were both common questions customers had about hotels.</li>
					<li>The hotel amenities filters were pushed higher up the page because they were used more often.</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>5. Test</h3>

			<div class="portfolio">

				<h4>User Feedback</h4>

				<p>We then took these designs and we reviewed then with some of the same phone agents that had completed the survey. The agents provided valuable feedback that we then incorporated into the next iteration of the design.</p>
